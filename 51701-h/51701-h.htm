<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<span class="reduct">HOW SHE CAME TO THE VILLAGE</span></h2>


<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">She</span> was a slip of a girl when first she
came to the village; slender and
delicate, with soft brown hair blowing
about her soft face. Those who saw
her coming down the street beside
Grandfather Merion thought he had
brought back one of his grandnieces
with him from the west for a visit; it
was known that he had been out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
there, and he had been away all
summer.</p>

<p>Anne Peace and her mother looked
up from their sewing as the pair went
by; Grandfather Merion walking slow
and stately with his ivory-headed stick
and his great three-cornered hat,
the last one left in the village, his kind
wise smile greeting the neighbors as
he met them; and beside him this
tall slender maiden in her light print
gown that the wind was tossing about,
as it tossed the brown cloud of hair
about her cheeks.</p>

<p>“Look, mother!” said Anne Peace.
“She is for all the world like a windflower,
so pretty and slim. Who is it,
think?”</p>

<p>“Some of his western kin, I s’pose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>”
said Widow Peace. “She is a pretty
piece. See if she’s got the new back,
Anne; I was wishful some stranger
would come to town to show us how it
looked.”</p>

<p>“Land, Mother,” said Anne; “her
gown’s nothing but calico, and might
have come out of the Ark, looks ’s
though; not but what ’tis pretty on
her. Real graceful! There! see her
look up at him, just as sweet! I expect
she is his grandniece, likely. There
they go in ’t the gate, and he’s left it
open, and the hens’ll get out. Rachel
won’t like that! She keeps her hens
real careful.”</p>

<p>“She fusses ’em most to death!”
said Mrs. Peace. “If I was a hen I
should go raving distracted if Rachel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Merion had the rearin’ of me. Why,
Anne! why, look at Rachel this minute,
runnin’ down the garden path. She
looks as if something was after her.
My sakes! she’s comin’ in here. What
in the&mdash;”</p>

<p>Rachel Merion, a tall handsome
young woman with a general effect of
black and red about her, came out of
her door and down the path like an
arrow shot from a bow. At one dash
she reached the gate and paused to
flash a furious look back at the house;
with a second dash she was across the
road, and in another instant she stood
in Mrs. Peace’s sitting-room, quivering
like a bowstring.</p>

<p>“Mis’ Peace!” she cried. “Anne!
he’s done it! he has! he has, I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
you! I’ll go crazy or drown myself;
I will! I will!”</p>

<p>She began beating the air with her
hands and screaming in short breathless
gasps. Mrs. Peace looked calmly at
her over her spectacles.</p>

<p>“There, Rachel!” she said. “You
are in a takin’, aren’t you? Set down
a spell, till you feel quieter, and then
tell us about it.”</p>

<p>Anne, seeing the girl past speech,
rose quietly, and taking her hand,
forced her to sit down; then taking a
bowl of water from the table, wet her
brow and head repeatedly, speaking
low and soothingly the while: “There,
Rachel! there! You’re better now,
aren’t you? Take a long breath, and
count ten slowly; there! there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The angry girl took a deep breath
and then another; soon the power of
speech returned, and broke out in a
torrent.</p>

<p>“I always knew he would!” she
cried. “I’ve looked for it ever since
Mother was cold in her grave and
before, you know I have, Anne Peace.
I looked for it with Aunt ’Melia till I
routed her out of the house, and I
looked for it with Mis’ Wiley till I sent
<i>her</i> flying. I wish’t now I’d let ’em
alone, both of ’em. I’d sooner he’d
married ’em both, and been a Turk
and done with it, instead of this.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peace looked over her spectacles
with mild severity.</p>

<p>“Rachel Merion,” she said, “what
are you talking about? If it’s your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
grandfather, why then I tell you plain,
that is no proper way for you to talk.
What has happened? speak out
plain!”</p>

<p>“He’s married!” Rachel fairly
shrieked. “Married to a girl of eighteen,
and brought her back to sit over
me and order me about in my own
house. I’ll teach ’em! I’ll let ’em see
if I’m going to be bossed round by
a brown calico rag doll. They’ll find
me dead on the threshold first.”</p>

<p>“<i>Married!</i>” cried Mrs. Peace and
Anne. “Oh, Rachel! it can’t be.
You can’t have understood him.
It’s one of his grandnieces, I expect,
your Aunt Sophia’s daughter. She
settled out west, I’ve always heard.”</p>

<p>“I tell you he’s married!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Rachel. “Didn’t he tell me so?
didn’t he lead her in by the hand
(she was scared, I’ll say that for her;
she’d better be!) and say ‘Rachel,
here’s my wife! here’s your little
grandmother that’s come to be a playmate
for you.’ Little grandmother!
that’s what I’ll call her, I guess. Let
her <i>be</i> a grandmother, and sit in the
chimney corner and smoke a cob pipe
and wear a cap tied under her chin.
But if ever she dares to sit in my chair,
I’ll kill her and myself too. Oh, Mis’
Peace, I wish I was dead! I wish
everybody was dead.”</p>

<p>So that was how Grandmother came
by her name. It seems strange that it
should have been first given as a taunt.</p>

<p>And while Rachel was raving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
weeping, and the good Peaces, who
tried to live up to their name, were
soothing her with quiet and comfortable
words, Grandmother was standing in
the middle of the great Merion kitchen,
with her hands folded before her in
the light pretty way she had, listening
to Grandfather; and while she listened
she looked to and fro with shy startled
glances, and seemed to sway lightly
from side to side, as if a breath would
move her; she was like a windflower,
as Anne Peace said.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t mind Rachel,”
Grandfather was saying, as he filled
his long pipe and settled himself in
his great chair. “She is like the wind
that bloweth where it listeth; where
it listeth. She has grown up motherless&mdash;like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
yourself, my dear, but with a
difference; with a difference; neither
your grandmother&mdash;I would say,
neither my wife nor I have ever governed
her enough. She has rather governed
me, being of that disposition; of that
disposition. Yes! But she is a fine
girl, and I hope you will be good
friends. This is the kitchen, where
we mostly sit in summer, for coolness,
you see; Rachel cooks mostly in the
back kitchen in summer. That is the
sitting-room beyond, which you will
find pleasant in cooler weather. That
is the pantry door, and that one opens
on the cellar stairs. Comfortable, all
very comfortable. I hope you will be
happy, my dear. Do you think you
will be happy?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked at her with a shade of
anxiety in his cheerful eyes, and waited
for her reply.</p>

<p>“Oh&mdash;yes!” said Grandmother,
with a flutter in her voice that told of
a sob somewhere near. “Yes, sir, if&mdash;if
she will not always be angry. Will
she always, do you think?”</p>

<p>“No! No!” said Grandfather;
“very soon, very soon, we’ll all be
comfortable, all be comfortable. Just
don’t mind her, my dear. Let her be,
and she’ll come round.”</p>

<p>He nodded wisely with his kind
grave smile. By and by he bade her
go out in the garden and gather a posy
for herself; and then he took his hat
and stepped across the road to Widow
Peace’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandmother started obediently, but
when she came to the garden door she
stopped and looked out with wide
startled eyes. Rachel in her scarlet
dress was down on her knees in the
poppy bed, the pride of her heart, and
was plucking up the poppies in furious
haste, dragging them up by the roots
and trampling them under her feet.</p>

<p class="p2">“It seemed the only thing to do!”
said Grandfather Merion, absently.
“Wild parts, Susan; wild parts,
ma’am! Her parents dead, as I told
you, and the child left with the innkeeper’s
wife, who was not&mdash;not a
person fitted to bring up a young girl;
no other woman&mdash;at least none of
suitable character near. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
clearly my duty to bring the child
away. Then&mdash;my search led me
into mining camps, and often I had
to be off alone among the mountains,
as a rumor came from here or there&mdash;the
marriage bond was a protection,
you see; yes, I was clear as to my duty.
But I confess I forgot about Rachel,
Susan, and Rachel is so ungoverned!
I fear she will not&mdash;a&mdash;not be subject
to my wife&mdash;whose name is
Pity, by the way, Susan; a quaint
name; she is a very good child. I
am sure you and little Annie will be
good to her.”</p>

<p>Good Widow Peace promised, and
so did Anne, her soft brown eyes
shining with good-will; but when he
was gone back, the old woman shook<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
her head. “No good can come of it!”
she said. “I hadn’t the heart to say
so, Anne, for poor Grandfather must
have a hard time, searching them cruel
mountains for his graceless son; but
no good can come of it.”</p>

<p>“But we can try!” said Anne.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="reduct">HOW THE FIRST LINE CAME IN HER
FACE</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">Rachel</span> did not kill herself, nor go
crazy; nor did she even go away, as
she threatened to do when she wearied
of announcing her imminent death.
She stayed and made things unpleasant
for Grandmother. She was barely
civil to her in Grandfather’s presence,
for she dared not be otherwise; but
the moment his back was turned she
was grimacing and threatening behind
it, and when he left the room she
would break out into open taunt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
menace. There was no name too
hateful for her to call the pale girl who
never reviled her in turn; but Grandmother’s
very silence was turned against
her.</p>

<p>“You needn’t think that I don’t
know why you’re dumb as a fish!”
raved the frantic girl. “You know
what I say is true, and you darsn’t
speak! you darsn’t! you darsn’t!&mdash;”
She stopped short; for Grandmother
had come and taken her by both wrists,
and stood gazing at her.</p>

<p>“Stop!” she said quietly. “That
is enough. Stop!”</p>

<p>They stood for some minutes, looking
into each other’s eyes; then Rachel
turned her head away with a sullen
gesture. “Let me go!” she said. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
don’t want to say anything more. I’ve
said enough. Let me go!”</p>

<p>These were bad hours, but there
were good ones too for little Grandmother.
She loved her housework,
and did it with a pretty grace and
quickness; she loved to sit by Grandfather
with her sewing, or read the
paper to him. She could not be doing
enough for the old man. She told
Anne Peace that he had saved her life.
“I should not have gone on living out
there,” she said, “it was not good to
live after my father died. I had one
friend, but he left me, and there were
only strangers when Grandfather came
and saved me. It is a little thing to
let her scold”&mdash;it was after one of
Rachel’s tantrums&mdash;“if only she will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
quiet before him, and not make him
grieve.”</p>

<p>But her happiest hours were in the
garden. It was a lovely place, the
Merion garden; not large, only a
hundred feet from the house to the
street; but this space was so set and
packed with flowers that from a
little distance it looked like a gay
carpet stretched before the old red
brick house. Small lozenge-shaped
beds, each a mass of brilliant color;
sweet-william, iris, pansies, poppies,
forget-me-nots, and twenty other
lovely things. Between the beds,
round and round like a slender
green ribbon, ran a little grassy
path, just wide enough for one person.
Grandmother would spend her best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
hours following this path; pacing slowly
along, stopping here to look and there
to smell, and everywhere to love.
She was like a flower herself, as she
drifted softly along in her light dress,
her soft hair blowing about her sweet
pale face; a windflower, as Anne
Peace said.</p>

<p>One day she had followed the path
till she came to where it ran along by
the old vine-covered brick wall that
stood between the garden and the
road. You could hardly see the wall
for the grapevines that were piled
thick upon it; and inside the vines
tumbled about, overrunning the long
bed of yellow iris that was the rearguard
of the garden.</p>

<p>Grandmother was talking as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
drifted slowly along; it was a way she
had, bred by her lonely life in the
western cabin; talking half to herself,
half to the long white lily that she held,
putting it delicately to her cheek now
and then, as if to feel which was the
smoother.</p>

<p>“But Manuel never came back!”
she was saying. “I never knew, white
lily, I never knew whether he was
alive or dead. That made it hard to
come away, do you see, dear? Whether
he was lost in the great snow up on
the mountains, or whether the Indians
caught him,&mdash;I can never know now,
lily dear; and he was my only friend
till Grandfather came, and I loved him&mdash;I
loved Manuel, white lily! Ah!
what is that?”</p>

CHEEK.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a smothered exclamation;
a rustle on the other side of the
wall. The next moment a figure
that had been lying under the wall
rose up and confronted Grandmother;
the figure of a young man,
tall and graceful, with the look of a
foreigner.</p>

<p>“Pitia!” cried the young man. “It
is you? You call me?&mdash;see, I come!
I am here, Manuel Santos.”</p>

<p>Yes, things happen so, sometimes,
more strangely than in stories.</p>

<p>He stretched out his arms across the
wall in greeting.</p>

<p>“Are you alive, Manuel?” asked
Grandmother, making the sign of the
cross, as her Spanish nurse had taught
her. “Are you alive, or a spirit?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Either way I am glad, oh, glad to see
you, Manuel!”</p>

<p>She drew near timidly, and timidly
reached out her hand and touched
his; he grasped it with a cry, and then
with one motion had leaped the wall
and caught her in his arms. “Pitia!”
he cried. “To me! mine, forever!”</p>

<p>He lifted her face to his, but in
breathless haste little Grandmother put
him from her and leaned back against
the wall, with hands outstretched keeping
him off.</p>

<p>“Manuel,” she said. “I have a
great deal to tell you. I thought&mdash;you
did not come back. I thought
you were dead.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the boy. “No wonder!
The Apaches got me and kept me all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
winter with a broken leg. What matter?
I got away. I found you had
come east. I found the man’s name
who brought you&mdash;found where he
lived. I followed. I come here an
hour ago, and lie down, I think by
chance, beneath the wall to rest. That
chance was the finger of Heaven. You
see, Pitia, it leads me to you. I take
you, you are mine, you go back with
me, as my wife.”</p>

<p>The little windflower was very white
as she leaned against the wall, still with
outstretched pleading hands; whiter
than the lily that lay at her feet.</p>

<p>“Manuel,” she said; “listen! I
was alone. Father died. There was
no woman save old Emilia&mdash;” the
lad uttered an oath, but she hurried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
on. “I could not&mdash;I could not stay.
I meant to die; I thought you dead,
and I&mdash;I was going up into the great
snow to end it, when&mdash;a good old
man came. Old, old, white as winter,
but good as Heaven. He saved me,
Manuel; he brought me here to his
home, and it is mine too. I am his
wife, Manuel.”</p>

<p>“His wife!” The young man stared
incredulous, his dark eyes full of pain
and trouble. “His wife&mdash;an old
man! You, my Pitia?” Suddenly
his face broke into laughter.</p>

<p>“I see!” he cried. “You punish
me, you try me&mdash;good! I take it all!
Go on, Pitia! more penance, I desire
it, because at the last I have you&mdash;so!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Once more he sprang towards her
with a passionate gesture; but the
slender white arms never wavered.</p>

<p>“I am his wife,” she repeated;
“the good old man’s wife. See&mdash;the
ring on my finger. They&mdash;they
call me Grandmother, Manuel dear.”</p>

<p>She tried to smile. “And you are
alive!” she said. “Manuel, that is
all I will think of; my friend is
alive, my only friend till Grandfather
came.”</p>

<p>Alas! poor little Grandmother, poor
little windflower; for now burst forth
a storm beside which Rachel’s rages
seemed the babble of a child. Cruel
names the boy called her, in his wild
passion of love and disappointment;
cruel, cruel words he said; and she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
stood there white and quiet, looking at
him with patient pleading eyes, but
not trying to excuse or defend.</p>

<p>“Ah!” he cried at last. “You are
not alive at all, I believe. You have
never lived, you do not know what life
is.”</p>

<p>That was the first time she heard it,
poor little Grandmother. She was to
hear it so many times. Now she put
her hand to her heart as if something
had pierced it; a spasm crossed her
smooth forehead, and when it passed
a line remained, a little line of pain.</p>

<p>But she only nodded and tried to
smile, and said, “Yes, sure, Manuel!
yes, sure!”</p>

<p>Then they heard Grandfather’s voice
behind them, and there was the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
old man standing, leaning on his stick
and looking at them with wonder.</p>

<p>“What is this?” said Grandfather.
“I heard loud and angry words.
Who is this, my dear?”</p>

<p>“This is Manuel, Grandfather; my
friend of whom I told you. He is
angry because I am married to you!”
said Grandmother simply; “but I am
always so thankful to you, Grandfather
dear!”</p>

<p>Grandfather looked kindly at the boy.
“I see!” he said. “Yes, yes; I see!
I see! But come into the house with
us, sir, and let us try to be friends.
Sorrow in youth is hard to bear, yet
it can be borne, it can be borne, and
we will help you if we may.”</p>

<p>And Grandmother said, “Yes, sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Manuel dear; come in and eat with
us; you must be hungry.”</p>

<p>A great sob burst from the boy’s
throat, and turning away he flung his
arm upon the vine-covered wall and
wept there.</p>

<p>“Go you into the house, my dear,”
said Grandfather; “and be getting
supper. We will come presently.”</p>

<p>Grandmother looked at him for a
moment; then she took his hand and
put it to her heart, with a pretty
gesture, looking into his face with
clear patient eyes; he laid his other
hand on her head, and they stood so
for a moment quietly, with no words;
then she went into the house.</p>

<p>And by and by Grandfather brought
Manuel in to supper, and Rachel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
was wonderfully civil, and they were
all quite cheerful together.</p>

<p>Manuel stayed, as we all know, and
worked for Grandfather on the farm,
and boarded with the Widow Peace
across the way; and he and Grandfather
were great friends, and he and
Rachel quarrelled and made up and
quarrelled again, over and over; and
always from that time there was a little
line on Grandmother’s smooth forehead.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="reduct">HOW SHE PLAYED WITH THE CHILDREN</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">I asked</span> Anne Peace once, when we
were talking about Grandmother (it
was not till the next year that we came
to the village), how soon it was that the
children found her out. Very soon,
Anne said. It began with their
trying to tease her by shouting “Grandmother!”
over the wall and running
away. She caught one of them and
carried him into the garden screaming
and kicking (she was strong, for all
her slenderness), and soon she had him
down in the grass listening to a story,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
eyes and mouth wide open, and all
the rest of them hanging over the wall
among the grapevines, “trying so hard
to hear you could ’most see their ears
grow!” said Anne, laughing.</p>

<p>“It was wonderful the way she had
with them. I used to wish she would
keep a school, after she was left alone,
but I don’t know; maybe she couldn’t
have taught them so much in the book
way; but where she learned all the
things she did tell ’em&mdash;it passes me.
I used to ask her: ’Grandmother,’
I’d say, ’where do you get it all?’
And she’d laugh her pretty way, and
say:</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Eye and ear,<br />
See and hear;<br />
Look and listen well, my dear!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p class="p1">That was all there was to it, she’d
say, but we knew better.”</p>

<p>I can remember her stories now.
Perhaps they were not so wonderful
as we thought; perhaps it was the way
she had with her that made them so
enchanting. I never shall forget the
story of the little Prince who would go
a-wooing. His mother, the old Queen,
said to him:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">
“Look she sweet or speak she fair,<br />
Mark what she does when they curl her hair!”</p>

<p class="p1">“So the little Prince started off on
his travels, and soon he met a beautiful
Princess with lovely curls as white as
flax. She looked sweet, and she spoke
fair, and the little Prince thought ‘Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
is the bride for me!’ But he minded
him of what his mother said, and when
the Princess went to have her hair
curled he stood under the window and
listened.</p>

<p>“And what did he hear, children?
He heard the voice that had spoken
him sweet as honey, but now it was
sharp and thin as vinegar. ‘Careless
slut!’ it said. ‘If you pull my hair
again I will have you beaten.’</p>

<p>“Then the little Prince shook his
head and sighed, and started again on
his travels. By and by he met another
Princess, and she was red as a rose,
with black curls shining like jet, and
her eyes so bright and merry that the
Prince thought, ‘Sure, this is the bride
for me!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Princess thought so too, and
she looked sweet and spoke fair; but
the Prince minded him of what his
mother had said, and when the Princess
went to have her hair curled he listened
again beneath the window. But oh,
children, what did he hear? Angry
words and stamping feet, and then a
sharp stinging sound; and out came
the maid flying and crying, with her
hand to her cheek that had been
slapped till it was red as fire. So
when the Prince saw that he sighed
again and shook his head, and started
off on his travels.</p>

<p>“Before long he met a third Princess,
and she was fair as a star, and her curls
like brown gold, and falling to her
knees. She looked so sweet that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Prince’s heart went out to her more
than to either of the others; but he was
afraid after what had passed, and waited
for the hour of the hair-curling. When
that came, he was going toward the
window, when there passed him a
young maiden running, with her face all
in a glow of happiness.</p>

<p>“‘Whither away so fast, pretty
maid?’ asked the Prince.</p>

<p>“‘Do not stay me!’ said the maid.
‘I go to curl the Princess’s hair, and I
must not be late, for it is the happiest
hour of my day.’</p>

<p>“‘Is it so?’ said the Prince.
‘Then will you tell the Princess that
when her hair is curled I pray that she
will marry me?’</p>

<p>“And so she did, children, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and they had a happy day for every
thread of her brown-gold hair, so I am
told, and there were  so many
threads, I think they must be alive to
this day.”</p>

<p>And the bird stories! and the story
of how the butterfly’s wings were
spotted! and the flower stories! I don’t
suppose there was a child in the village
in those days who did not believe that
at night all the flowers in Grandfather
Merion’s garden were dancing round
the fairy ring in the home pasture.</p>

<p>“And Sweet William said to Clove
Pink, ‘How sweet the fringe on your
gown is! Will you dance with me,
pretty lady?’ So they danced away
and away, and they met Bachelor’s
Button waltzing with Cowslip, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
young Larkspur kicking up his heels
with Poppy Gay, and Prince’s Feather
bowing low before sweet white Lily
in her satin gown, and Crown Imperial
leading out Queen Rose&mdash;oh! but
she was a queen indeed! And the
music played&mdash;such music! the locust
went tweedle, tweedle, tweedle, and
the cricket went chirp, chirp, chirp,
and the big green frog that played the
bass viol said ‘glum! glum! glum!’
And they danced&mdash;oh, they danced!</p>

<p>“Whirl about, twirl about, hop, hop,
hop! till&mdash;hush! something happened.
Oh! children, come close while I
whisper. The green turf of the Ring
trembled and shook&mdash;and opened&mdash;and&mdash;oh!
off go the flowers scampering
back to bed as fast as they can go;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
and in their places&mdash;oh! hush! oh,
hush! I must not tell.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Green jacket, red cap, and white owl’s feather!</p>

<p class="pn1">Little lights that twinkle, little bells
that jingle, little feet that trip, trip&mdash;</p>

<p>“Hush, children! we must not look.
Home again, we too, after the flowers!”</p>

<p>And she would catch their hands
and run with them round and round
the field till all were out of breath with
running and laughter.</p>

<p>The Saturday feasts were begun,
Anne Peace reminded me, for the little
lame girl who lived a mile beyond the
village. The poor little soul had
heard of all the merry play that went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
on at Merion Farm, and had begged
her father to bring her in. So one day
a long lean tattered man came to the
gate and looked wistfully in at Grandmother,
who was making daisy chains
against the children’s coming.</p>

<p>“Mornin’!” he said. “Mis’ Merion to home?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grandmother; “at least I am here.
Would you like something?”</p>

<p>“I swow!” said the man. He looked
helplessly at the girlish figure a moment.
Then&mdash;“My little gal heard tell how
that you told yarns to young ’uns, and
nothin’ to it but I must fetch her in.
She&mdash;she ain’t very well&mdash;” his rough
voice faltered, and he looked back to
his wagon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is she there?” cried Grandmother.
“Oh, but bring her in! bring her in
quickly! why, you darling, I am so
glad you have come.”</p>

<p>A poor little huddle of humanity;
hunchbacked, with the strange steadfast
eyes of her kind,&mdash;wise with
their own knowledge, which is apart
from all knowledge revealed to those
whose backs are straight,&mdash;lame, too,
drawn and twisted this way and that,
as if Nature had been a naughty child
playing with a doll, tormenting it in
sheer wantonness.</p>

<p>A piteous sight; and still more
piteous the shrinking look of her and
of the poor gaunt wistful father, watchful
for a rebuff, a smile, some one of
the devilishly cruel tricks that humanity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
startles into when it touches
the unusual.</p>

<p>But Grandmother’s arms were out,
and Grandmother’s face was shining
with clear light, like an alabaster lamp.
Oh, one would know that her name
was Pity, even though none used the
name now, even Manuel, even Grandfather
himself calling her Grandmother.</p>

<p>“Darling!” she said, and she hugged
the child close to her, as if she would
shield it from all the world. “Here is
a daisy chain for you. See! I will put
it round your neck. Now you are mine
for the whole afternoon. Good father
will go&mdash;” she nodded to the man;
“go and do the errands, and see to all
his business, and then when it gets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
toward supper-time he will come back
and pick you up and carry you off.
And now we’ll go and make some posies
for the others; my name is Grandmother;
what is yours, darling? whisper now!”</p>

<p>The man turned away, and brushed
his hand across his eyes. “Gosh!”
he said simply. “I guess you’re a
good woman.”</p>

<p>“I’m just Grandmother,” said the
girl; “that’s all, isn’t it, Nelly? Good-bye,
father!”</p>

<p>“Good-bye, father!” echoed the
child, clinging round Grandmother’s
neck as though she feared she might
vanish suddenly into thin air.</p>

<p>“Sure she won’t pester ye?” said
the man, timidly. “She’s real clever!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“You won’t pester me, will you,
Nelly?” said Grandmother.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Nelly Nell, Nelly Nell,<br />
Come and hear the flowers tell<br />
How they heed you,<br />
Why they need you,<br />
How they mean to love you well.”</p>

<p class="pn1">And off they went together, little
Nelly nodding and waving her hand,
with a wholly new smile on her pale
shrivelled face.</p>

<p>“Gosh!” said the father again;
he had not many words, and only one
to express emotion.</p>

<p>When the other children came, they
found a little girl with a radiant face,
crowned with a forget-me-not wreath,
and with the prettiest pale blue scarf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
over her shoulders, all embroidered
with butterflies. She was sitting in a
low round chair with cushioned back,
and chair and cushion and child were
all heaped and garlanded with flowers,
daisies and lilies, pink hawthorn and
great drifts of snowballs.</p>

<p>Grandmother called to them, “Come
children, come! here is the Queen of
the May. Her name is Nelly, and she
has come to stay to tea, and you shall
all stay too.”</p>

<p>The children came up half shy,
half bold.</p>

<p>“What makes her sit so funny?”
asked a very little boy.</p>

<p>“You be still or I’ll bat your head
off!” muttered his elder brother savagely.
No one else made any mistake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
and most of them were careful not to
look too much at Nelly; children are
gentlefolk, if you take them the right
way.</p>

<p>Then they listened to the story of
the princess in the brown dress; how
she came into the town, and no one
knew she was a princess at all, but
every one said, “See the poor woman
in the tattered brown gown!” But
the princess did not mind. She went
hither and thither, up and down, and
whenever she met any one who was in
need, she put her hand inside the
folds of her gown, and brought out a
piece of gold or a shining jewel, and
gave it to the poor person. So when
this had gone on for some time, people
began to talk one to another. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
said, “Where does this beggar woman
get the gold and the gems that she
gives?”</p>

<p>“She must have begged them!”
said another.</p>

<p>“Or stolen them!” said a third.</p>

<p>Then all the people cried out, “She
is a thief! let her be stripped and
beaten!”</p>

<p>So they brought the princess to the
market-place; and cruel men seized
her and pulled off her tattered brown
gown; and oh! and oh! children,
what do you think? there stood the
most radiant princess that ever was
seen upon earth; her dress was of pure
woven gold, and set from top to hem
with precious stones so bright that the
sun laughed in every one of them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
her hair (for they had pulled off her
cap too) was as fair gold as the dress,
and fell around her like a golden cloak.
So she stood for a minute like heaven
come to earth; and then all in a
moment she vanished away, and only
the tattered brown dress was left for
them to do what they would with.</p>

<p>“So, darlings, be very careful to be
nice to everybody, especially to anyone
in a shabby brown dress, for there
may always be a princess inside it.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a princess, Grandmother?”
asked a child.</p>

<p>“Oh, I so seldom see any other kind
of person,” said Grandmother, “except
princes. You have no idea how
many I know. No, I can’t tell you
their names; you’ll have to find them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
out for yourselves; and now it is time
for a game.”</p>

<p>They were quiet games that they
played that afternoon; but as the
children said afterwards, some of the
best games are quiet. And then came
the Feast; a wonderful feast, with a
great jug of creamy milk, and all the
bread and honey that any one could eat,
and little round tarts besides.</p>

<p>“Look at that!” said Rachel to
Manuel. They had been for a walk,
and came back through the orchard,
where the feast was held. “We were
going to have those tarts for tea, and
she has given every last one to those
brats. That’s all she cares for, just
childishness. She’s nothing but a child
herself.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“Nothing but a child!” echoed
Manuel, and he added, “She has
never lived; sometimes I think she
never will.”</p>

<span class="reduct">HOW SHE SANG GRANDFATHER TO SLEEP</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">Grandfather</span> began to fail. He
complained of no pain or distress;
but his stately figure seemed to shrink,
and his head that he used to hold so
high was now bowed on his breast,
and he began to creep and shuffle in
his walk. Widow Peace said the
change had begun when he came back
from the vain search for his graceless
son, and I think it was true. “He
won’t more than last out the winter,”
said Mrs. Peace, “if he does that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
The Merions don’t run much above
seventy.”</p>

<p>“Don’t, mother!” said Anne.</p>

<p>“Don’ting won’t stop the course of
nature,” said her mother, “nor yet is
it proper you should say ‘Don’t’ to me,
Anne Peace.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon, mother; I
meant no harm.”</p>

<p>“No more you did, daughter. You
may hand me the tape measure. Anne,
if you can tell me how to cut this dress
so as to make Mis’ Broadback look
like anything besides Behemoth in the
Bible I shall be obliged to you.”</p>

<p>“You’re real funny, mother!” said
Anne, who never quite understood her
parent.</p>

<p>“Fun keeps the fiddle going!” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Mrs. Peace. “You may cut them
gores if you’re a mind to, Anne.
There’s Rachel and Manuel goin’ off
again. S’pose they’re goin’ to make a
match of it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, mother!” said little Anne.</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Oh,’ said the owl, and set up a hootin’,<br />
But Jabez kept still when he done the shootin’.”</p>

<p class="pn1">What does Grandmother do these days?
I haven’t seen her go out of the gate
for a week and more. You were over
this morning, wasn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Anne. “Oh, mother,
she just sits by Grandfather all the
time&mdash;when her work is done, that’s
to say; Grandmother never slights
anything; sits by him all day, reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to him when he’s awake, or talking,
or singing those little songs he likes;
and when he drops off asleep she just
reaches for her sewing and sits and
waits till he wakes up. And she’s
growing so white and thin&mdash;there! it
just makes me ache to see her. I said
to her ‘Grandmother,’ I said, ‘when
he drops off asleep that way, you’d
ought to slip out into the garden for a
mouthful of air, even if you don’t go
no further. Rachel can stay round,’
I said, ‘case he should want anything,’
I said. But she just shook her head.
‘No, Anne!’ she says. ‘I must be
here,’ she says. ‘He has been so good
to me; so good to me; he must
always find me here when he wants
me.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>“And sure enough, mother, directly
he woke up, before he opened his
eyes he says ‘You here, Grandmother?’
kinder restless like, and she
says ‘Yes, Grandfather, right here!’
and laid her hand on his and began
to sing, and he smiled real happy and
contented, said he didn’t want anything
except just to know that she was there.
But, mother, ’tis a sweet pretty sight
now, to see them two together. Of
course he’s an old man and she’s a
young girl, but yet&mdash;well, they aren’t
like other folks, neither one of them.
What makes you look like that,
mother?”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever was like other folks
that ever I heard of,” said Widow
Peace rather grimly. “Now you be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
quiet, Anne Peace. Here comes
Rachel.”</p>

<p>Rachel Merion came flying in, splendid
in her scarlet dress. “How do,
Mis’ Peace?” she said. “Anne, will
you lend me that mantilla pattern?
I want to make one out of some of
that black lace Grandmother Willard
had. Will you, Anne? hurry up, I
can’t wait.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peace looked at her with mild
severity. “Rachel,” she said; “sit
down a spell. I want to speak to you.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can’t, Mis’ Peace!” said
Rachel. “Manuel’s waiting for me
outside.”</p>

<p>“Manuel <i>can</i> wait,” said Mrs. Peace.
“It’ll do him good. Sit down,
Rachel!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’d full as lives stand, thank you,”
said Rachel sullenly.</p>

<p>“I asked you to sit down,” said
Mrs. Peace quietly; and Rachel sat
down with a flounce on the edge of a
chair, and listened with lowering brows.</p>

<p>“I want to speak to you about
Grandmother,” said the little widow.
“She isn’t well; Anne sees it, and I
see it. She’s outdoing her strength,
caring for Grandfather all day long,
and I think you’d ought to help her
more than what you do.”</p>

<p>Rachel’s eyes flashed under their
black brows.</p>

<p>“She wanted him,” she said, “and
she got him; now let her see to him.
I don’t feel no call to take care of
Grandfather; he isn’t my husband.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>Anne’s soft eyes glowed with indignation.
She was about to speak,
her mother motioned her to silence.
“Rachel Merion,” she said. “You’d
ought to be slapped, and I’ve a good
part of a mind to do it. You’re careless
and shiftless, and heathen; and you’ll
neither do good nor get it in this world
till you get a human heart in your
bosom. Grandmother is worth twenty
of you, and I pay her no compliment
either in saying it; it shows what she
is, that she has put up with your
actions so long. I wouldn’t have, not a
single week. I’d have drove you out
with a broomstick, Rachel, and give
you time to learn manners before I let
you in again. There! now I’ve said
my say, and you can go.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>As Anne said, it was a pretty sight
there, in the Merion kitchen. The
good old man sat in his great armchair,
dozing or dreaming the hours away,
less and less inclined to stir as the weeks
went on; and always beside him was
the slight figure in the clear print dress,
watching, waiting, tending; yes, it was
pretty enough.</p>

<p>“Sing, Grandmother!” he would
say now and then; and Grandmother
would sing in her low sweet voice, like
a flute:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Sweet sleep to fold me,<br />
Sweet dreams to hold me;<br />
Listen, oh! listen!<br />
This the angels told me.<br />
Fair grow the trees there,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>Soft blows the breeze there,<br />
Golden ways, golden days,<br />
When will ye enfold me?”</p>

<p class="p1">Or that quaint little old song that he
specially liked:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“As I went walking, walking,<br />
I heard St. Michael talking,<br />
He spoke to sweet St. Gabriel,<br />
The one who loves my soul so well,</p>
<p class="pp6s">‘Oh, brother, tell me here,<br />
Why hold that soul so dear?’</p>
<p class="pp6s">‘Because, alas, since e’er ‘twas born,<br />
I feel the piercing of its thorn.’”</p>

<p class="p1">Or it would be the song of the river,
and that she loved to sing, because
Grandfather would fall asleep to the
soft lulling time of it:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Flow, flow, flow down river,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Carry me down to the sea!<br />
Ropes of silk and a cedar paddle,<br />
For to set my spirit free.<br />
Roll, roll, rolling billow;<br />
Smooth, smooth my sleepy pillow:<br />
Silver sails and a cedar paddle,<br />
For to set my spirit free!</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Long, long work and weeping,<br />
Trying for to do my best:<br />
Soon, soon, time for sleeping;<br />
Cover me up to rest!<br />
Roll, roll, rolling billow,<br />
Smooth, smooth my sleepy pillow,<br />
Golden masts and a cedar paddle,<br />
For to set my spirit free!”</p>

<p class="p1">One day she was singing this, softer
and softer, till she thought Grandfather
was fast asleep. Lower and lower
sank the lulling voice, till at length it
died away in a sigh. Then she sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
silent, looking at him; at the good
white head, the broad forehead, with
its strong lines of toil and thought, all
the kind face that she knew and loved
well now. She sighed again, not
knowing that she did; and at that
Grandfather opened his eyes without
stirring and looked at her&mdash;oh, so
kindly!</p>

<p>“Little Grandmother,” he said.
“You know I am going soon?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandfather!” said she.</p>

<p>“You have been a good, good
child,” said Grandfather; “a good
and faithful child, and when I go my
blessing stays with you. You are
young, and I want you to be happy.
Perhaps you will like to marry Manuel,
my dear?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandmother lifted her clear eyes
to his.</p>

<p>“Yes, Grandfather!” she said.</p>

<p>“He is not good enough for you,”
said Grandfather, “but&mdash;well! well!
you are both young, both young, and
youth is a great thing. I was young
myself&mdash;a long, long time ago, my
dear.” He was silent.</p>

<p>Grandmother knelt down beside him,
and took his hand in her own two,
stroking it and singing softly.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Silver sails and a cedar paddle,<br />
For to set my spirit free.”</p>

<p class="p1">Presently he looked up, and spoke
hurriedly, in a strange, confused voice.</p>

<p>“Mary!” he said. “Are you
there?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>Now Mary was the name of the wife
of his youth. Grandmother was silent.</p>

<p>“Are you there, Mary?” asked the
old man impatiently. “‘Tis so dark
I can’t see you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am here!” said Grandmother.</p>

<p>“‘Tis time to light up!” said Grandfather.
“We mustn’t sit here in the
dark like old folks, Mary. Let me
get up and light the lamps.”</p>

<p>The afternoon light fell clear on his
face with its open sightless eyes, and
on the angel face turned up to it in
faithful love.</p>

<p>“Wait just a little, John,” said
Grandmother. “I&mdash;I love the twilight;
’tis restful. Let&mdash;let me rest
a bit before we light up, won’t you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Surely, Mary; surely, my dear.
We’ll rest together then; I&mdash;I am
tired too, I&mdash;think.”</p>

<p>There was a long silence. The light
was growing softer, fainter; the old
clock ticked steadily; a coal tinkled
from the fire.</p>

<p>“Mary&mdash;you are there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, dear!”</p>

<p>“Song&mdash;the sleepy song; I think I
shall sleep.”</p>

<p>Hush! rest, dear white head, on my
breast; close, poor eyes that cannot
see the light. Rest, rest, in the quiet
twilight!</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Roll, roll, rolling billow,<br />
Smooth, smooth my sleepy pillow,<br />

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER V<br />
HOW THE SECOND LINE CAME IN HER
FOREHEAD</h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">It</span> was when Grandfather died that
the second line came across Grandmother’s
clear forehead. Sometimes&mdash;when
she was playing with the children,
for example&mdash;it was so faint one
hardly noticed it; but again it would
be deep, a line of thought&mdash;or was it
pain?&mdash;drawn straight as by a ruler.
Manuel noticed it one day, and spoke
of it.</p>

<p>“You look troubled, Grandmother.
What is it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>“I have lost my best friend, Manuel,”
said Grandmother. “I may well
look troubled; yet it is not trouble
either, only sorrow, for missing him,
and for wishing I had done more for
him.”</p>

<p>“No one could have done more,”
said Manuel; “you were an angel to
him.” He was silent a moment; then
he said, “You used to call me your best
friend&mdash;once. Shall I call you Pitia
again, Grandmother?”</p>

<p>Something in his tone&mdash;or was it
something <i>not</i> there?&mdash;drew the line
deeper across the white forehead. She
waited a moment before she spoke, and
then answered carefully, keeping an
even tone:</p>

<p>“Perhaps ‘Grandmother’ is better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Manuel; we are all used to it, you
know. Why should we change?”</p>

<p>“As you please!” said Manuel;
and whether there was more regret
or relief in his voice, who shall say?
He lingered a moment, hesitating, with
words on his lips which seemed to hang,
unready for utterance; and Grandmother
stood very still, only her breath
fluttering a little; but he need not see
that, and did not.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the garden came a
voice, clear, shrill, imperious; Rachel’s
voice. “Manuel, where are you? I
want you! come, quick.”</p>

<p>Manuel gave one glance at the still
face; hesitated a moment; then muttering
something about “Back soon!”
he went out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Little Grandmother stood very still.
Sounds crept through her ears,&mdash;the
clock ticking, the old cat purring on
the hearth, the song-sparrow singing
loud and clear in the apple-tree outside
the sitting-room window,&mdash;but
she did not heed them. Her eyes were
wide open, fixed on the door through
which Manuel had gone. It formed a
lovely picture, blossoming trees, waving
grass (winter had come and gone since
Grandfather died), gay flower-beds;
but she did not see them. Only when
two figures crossed the space, a girl in
a scarlet dress, a man at her side, looking
down as she laughed up in his face,
Grandmother shivered a little, and
went over to where the great work-basket
stood, and caught up her sewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
with a kind of passion. “I have you!”
she said. “You are mine, good little
stitches dear, kind, good little
stitches!”</p>

<p>If I have not said much about
Manuel, it is because there is not
very much to say. He was a handsome
lad, and a merry one. His laziness
did not show much till after Grandfather’s
death, for he feared and loved
the old man, and did his best to please
him. How he should have made the
effort to cross the Continent in search
of Grandmother was one of the things
that could not be understood. It was
like a fire of straw, as Mrs. Peace
said; it burned up bright, but there
were no coals left.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peace had little patience with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Manuel. He had been boarding with
her now for two years, and had never
once, so she said, wiped his feet as
they should be wiped when he came
into the house. Also she pronounced
him lazy, shiftless, careless, and selfish.</p>

<p>“If he marries Rachel,” she said,
“there’ll be a pair of ’em, and a
precious pair, too. I’m going to give
him a piece of my mind before I sleep
to-night.”</p>

<p>“That’s a real pretty skirt of
Rachel’s, mother,” said Anne. “Don’t
you want I should stroke the gathers?”</p>

<p>“You may stroke the gathers, Anne,
but you can’t stroke me,” said her
mother gently. “I tell you I am going
to give that fellow a piece of my mind.
Yes, it is a pretty dress, and it’s the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
third Rachel Merion has had this
spring, and if you’ll tell me when
Grandmother has had a new dress,
I’ll give you the next ninepence that’s
coined.”</p>

<p>“Grandmother always looks like a
picture, I’m sure,” said Anne.</p>

<p>“I’ve no special patience with
Grandmother,” said Mrs. Peace, “nor
yet with you, Anne Peace. If the Lord
had meant for us to be angels here,
it’s likely he would have provided us
with wings and robes, ’cordin’ to.
When I see an angel in a calico dress
goin’ round askin’ folks won’t they
please wipe their feet on her and save
their carpets, I want to shake her.”</p>

<p>“Shake Grandmother?” said Anne,
opening great eyes of reproach.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s Manuel now!” said
Widow Peace. “You might take this
waist home to Mis’ Wyman, if you’ve
a mind to, Anne.”</p>

<p>It is not known precisely what Mrs.
Peace said to Manuel Santos. Anne,
on her return from Mrs. Wyman’s, met
him coming out, in a white flame of
rage. He glared at her, and muttered
something under his breath, but made
no articulate reply.</p>

<p>“Chatterin’ mad, he was!” Mrs.
Peace said calmly, in answer to Anne’s
anxious questions. “Fairly chatterin’
mad. I don’t know, Anne, whether
I’ve done harm or good, but something
had to be done, and there’s
times when harm is better than nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, Mother Peace!” exclaimed
Anne, aghast. “How you talk!”</p>

<p>“It don’t sound pretty, does it?”
said the widow; “but I believe it’s
a fact. Something will happen now,
you see if it don’t.”</p>

<p>Something did happen. Manuel,
still white and inarticulate with rage,
met Rachel in the garden, on his way
to the house; Rachel in her red dress,
with scarlet poppies in her hair and
hands. She was waiting for him, perhaps;
certainly, at sight of him, the
color and light flashed into her face in
a way that might have moved a stronger
man than Manuel.</p>

<p>“Manuel!” she cried. “What’s
the matter? what makes you look so
queer? are you sick, Manuel?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes!” cried the man roughly. “I
am sick! sick of this place, sick of
these people. I am going away, back
to the west, where a man can live without
being watched and spied upon and
stung by ants and wasps.”</p>

<p>“Going away! Manuel!” the poppies
dropped from the girl’s hands, the
rich color fled from her cheeks. “If
you go,” she said simply, “I shall die.”
Rachel had never learned to govern
herself.</p>

<p>Well, after that there was only one
way out of it&mdash;at least for a man like
Manuel. Among all these cold, thin-blooded
Eastern folk, here was one
whose blood ran warm and swift and
red like his own. No satin lily that a
man dared not touch, but a bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
poppy like those in her hair, fit and
ready to be gathered. Yet when he
passed the white lilies, with his arm
round the girl, his promised wife&mdash;even
while he looked down at the rapture of
her face and thrilled at the thrill in her
voice&mdash;the fragrance of the lilies
seemed a tangible thing, like a thorn
that pierced him.</p>

<p>At the garden door they parted. He
had to see to the stock, he said; would
Rachel tell Grandmother?</p>

<p>Rachel ran into the house, calling
Grandmother. There was no answer;
but listening she heard the sound of the
wheel in the big empty chamber overhead.
She ran up-stairs, still calling.
Grandmother was spinning wool&mdash;she
loved to spin&mdash;at the great wool-wheel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
stepping lightly back and forward;
but at the first sound of Rachel’s
voice below she stopped, and put her
hand to her heart. She was standing
so when the girl rushed in, panting
and radiant.</p>

<p>“Grandmother! why didn’t you
answer? didn’t you hear me?” She
never waited for an answer but ran on
in a torrent of speech. “Grandmother,
I’ve been hateful to you, and
I’m sorry. Do you hear? I’m sorry,
sorry; I’m so happy now, I mean to
be good, good all the time. Do you
know what’s going to happen, Grandmother?
guess! I’ll give you three
guesses&mdash;no, I won’t, I won’t give
you one! I must tell you. I am going
to marry Manuel. Grandmother, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
you glad? You are so good, I suppose
you’ll be glad. I should hate you, I
should kill you, if it were you who were
going to marry Manuel. Do you
know”&mdash;she caught her breath a
moment, then laughed on, the laugh
rippling through her speech&mdash;“do
you know, Grandmother, I have been
jealous of you. I’ve always been
jealous I guess; first because of
Grandfather&mdash;poor old Grandfather,
what a pity he isn’t alive to know!&mdash;and
then&mdash;and lately&mdash;oh, Grandmother,
I didn’t know&mdash;I didn’t know
but he might care about you. Are you
laughing? it is funny, isn’t it?” But
Grandmother was not laughing.</p>

<p>“I might have known!” the girl
went on, “I needn’t have been afraid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
need I, Grandmother? You aren’t
like other folks, you’ve never lived;
you don’t know what life is, do you,
Grandmother? I’d be sorry for you if
I wasn’t so glad for myself, so glad, so
glad! Do you think I’m crazy? I
want to kiss you, little Grandmother!
What’s the matter? did my pin scratch
you?”</p>

<p>Grandmother had given a cry as the
girl flung her arms round her; a little
low cry, instantly silent.</p>

<p>“Yes&mdash;dear,” she said quietly, but
with that little flutter in her voice
that one who loved her might have
noticed; “I think it must have been
the pin. Oh, Rachel,” she said, “I
hope you will be so happy, so happy!
I hope there will never be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
but happiness for you and Manuel, my
dear.”</p>

<p>Rachel opened her dark eyes wide.
“Why, of course there won’t!” she
said.</p>

<p>“Grandmother’s all right!” she said
an hour later, when she had run to
meet her lover in the dewy orchard,
and they were coming home together
in the sunset light; “she’s all right.
She didn’t say much&mdash;I don’t know as
I gave her a chance, Manuel. I had so
much to say myself; but she was real
pleased, and wished me joy. She’s
good, Grandmother is. I mean never
to be hateful to her again if I can help
it. How sweet those lilies smell,
Manuel!”</p>

<p>“Is she happy, do you think?” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Manuel; it seemed to say itself, without
will of his.</p>

<p>“Who? Grandmother? of course
she is! You don’t expect her to cry
all her life for an old man, do you?
She’s as happy as a person can be who
has never lived. Hush! hear her
singing this minute!”</p>

<p>Yes! hear her singing, in the quiet
twilight garden where she walks alone.</p>

<p class="pp6qs p1">“‘Oh! brother, tell me here</p>
<p class="pp7">Why hold that soul so dear?’</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="reduct">HOW SHE WENT VISITING</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">It</span> was after Rachel’s marriage that
Grandmother first began to go about
in the village. Till then she had always
kept pretty much within the four walls
of the Merion garden, and people
thought she was proud, until they came
to know her. But now a restlessness
seemed to come over her, and she was
away from home a good deal. She
did not go to “circles” and meetings&mdash;one
would as soon have expected to
see a white birch walk into the vestry&mdash;nor
did she make what we loved to call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
“society calls;” but she found out the
people who were sick or sad or lonely&mdash;the
Peaces always knew&mdash;and she
went to them, sometimes with Anne to
introduce her, oftener alone, making
some errand, taking a flower, or a pot
of jelly or the like. Old Aunt Betsy
Taggart was living then, the white old
woman who had taken to her bed so
long ago that none of us young folks
ever knew why she had done it. Indeed,
I think Anne and I rather supposed
she had always been there&mdash;grew
there, perhaps, like some strange
old white flower. She was the most
independent old soul, Aunt Betsy. It
seemed terrible for her to live there
alone, but it was the only way she
would live. Her niece, Hepsy Babbage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
came in morning and evening, and
“did for” the old lady, but she was
not allowed to stay more than an hour
at a time. “My soul is my own,”
Aunt Betsy used to say, “and I like
to be able to call it so, my dear!”
Hepsy was a great talker, certainly;
and Aunt Betsy did her own cooking
over a lamp that stood on the table by
her bed, and actually made her own
butter in a little churn that Wilbur
Babbage made for her the winter before
he died. (Anne Peace never would let
me say that Wilbur was talked to
death, but she could not prevent her
mother’s saying so.)</p>

<p>Well, Grandmother and Aunt Betsy
took to each other from the first
moment, and never a week passed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Grandmother did not spend an afternoon
with the old lady and take tea.
Aunt Betsy seemed to know all about
her at once, which Anne and I never
did, though we adored her.</p>

<p>“Come here, child!” she said when
she came in with Anne, the first time.
“I’ve heard of you, and I’m glad to
see you. Come and let me have a look
at you!” She took Grandmother’s
hand in hers, and the two looked at
each other, a long quiet look. “Ah!”
said Aunt Betsy at last. “Yes, I see.
The upper and the nether millstone,
my child!”</p>

<p>Grandmother nodded simply; then
in a moment she began to talk about
the flowers she had brought, and how
Anne had helped her pick them, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
what a comfort Anne and her mother
were to her.</p>

<p>“Such good neighbors!” she said.
“Such dear, good, kind, neighbors!
This place is so full of good people,
Miss Taggart.”</p>

<p>“They call me Aunt Betsy,” said
the old lady, “and they call you Grandmother,
I’m told.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grandmother laughing;
“that is my name, isn’t it,
Anne?”</p>

<p>Anne says that she had really forgotten
that she had ever had any other
name.</p>

<p>“We shall be friends, you and I!”
said Aunt Betsy; “and you will find
good people wherever you look for
them, my dear.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes, surely!” said Grandmother;
and they looked at each
other again, that quiet understanding
look.</p>

<p>I don’t suppose Anne was very much
younger than Grandmother, but she
felt a whole lifetime between them,
and worshipped the older girl with a
very real worship. Grandmother took
it sweetly and quietly, as she took
everything. When Anne brought some
offering, the first bride-rose from her
bush, or a delicate cake, or a sunset-colored
jelly in a glass bowl, Grandmother
would thank her affectionately,
and admire the gift, and then would
say, “But it is too pretty for any well
person, my dear. Let us take it quickly
to little Kitty who is so suffering with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
her measles! or to poor old Mr.
Peavy, whose rheumatism is bad this
week.”</p>

<p>Anne confessed to me that she sometimes
wanted to say, “But I made it
for you, Grandmother, not for Mr.
Peavy!” but I have often thought that
Anne was in a manner serving an
apprenticeship to Grandmother, and
making ready, all unawares, for the
life of love and sacrifice that she too
was to lead.</p>

<p>Another of Grandmother’s friends
was Parker Patton. He was bedridden,
too&mdash;I think we were rather proud of
our two stationary (I cannot say helpless)
people; he had fallen from a
haystack&mdash;a strong man he was, in the
prime and pride of life&mdash;and injured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
his spine so that he could never walk
again.</p>

<p>He was not a pleasant man, most
people thought; he had a crabbed,
knotty disposition, and who can wonder
at it? The first time Grandmother
went to see him he snapped at her,
like some strong surly old dog.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” he said, bending
his bushy eyebrows over his bright
dark eyes. “Who is it?” to his wife,
who was hovering with anxious civility.
“Gran’ther Merion’s widder? humph!
you don’t look like a fool, but no more
did he. What ye want, hey?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father!” said poor Mrs. Patton.
“Don’t talk so! Mis’ Merion’s
come to visit with you a spell. I’m
sure she’s real&mdash;”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>“Get out!” said Parker. “Get out
of the room, d’ye hear?”</p>

<p>The poor timid soul backed out,
murmuring some apology to the visitor,
whom she expected to follow her; but
Grandmother stood still, looking at
him with her quiet sweet eyes.</p>

<p>“You can follow her!” said Parker.
“She likes to see company; I don’t!
I speak plain, and say what I mean.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go very soon!” said Grandmother.
“I’d like to stay a few
minutes; may I?”</p>

<p>“If I’m to be made a show of,”
growled the cross old man, “I shall
charge admission same as any other
show. Think it’s worth a quarter to
see a man with a broken back? If
you do you can stay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>“I haven’t a quarter,” said Grandmother,
“but it’s worth something to
sit down in this comfortable chair.
Were you ever at sea, Mr. Patton?”</p>

<p>“Ya-a-ow!” snarled Mr. Patton.
It sounded almost as much like “no”
as “yes,” but Grandmother did not
heed it much. She had dropped lightly
into the chair, and was looking at a
picture that hung opposite the bed; a
colored lithograph of a ship under full
sail. The workmanship was rough
and poor, but the waves were alive,
and the ship moved.</p>

<p>“I like that!” said Grandmother
softly. “I never saw the sea, but I
knew a sailor once.” She began to
sing very softly, hardly above her
breath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“There were two gallant ships<br />
Put out to sea.<br />
Sing high, sing low, and so sailed we.<br />
The one was Prince of Luther and the other Prince of Wales;<br />
Sailing down along the coast of the high Barbarie;<br />
Sailing down along the coast of the high Barbarie.”</p>

<p class="p1">“Who taught you that?” growled
Parker Patton.</p>

<p>“A sailor; his name was Neddard,
Neddard Prowst. He came&mdash;”
The sick man started up on his
elbows.</p>

<p>“Neddard Prowst! he was a shipmate
of mine; we sailed together three
years, and if I hadn’t come ashore like
a grass-fool we might be sailing yet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Where did you see Neddard, young
woman?”</p>

<p>“In the mountains. He came ashore;
he thought he would like mining, but
he didn’t. He was always longing for
the sea.”</p>

<p>“Ah! I’ll lay my cargo he was.
All seamen have their foolish times. I
thought I was tired of the sea; all I
wanted in the world was to lay under a
tree and eat apples, day after day.
Well&mdash;here I lay, and serve me
right. What about Neddard, young
woman?”</p>

<p>“He was very good to me,” she said.
“He liked me to sit with him when he
was sick; he died a little before I came
here. He taught me all the songs. Do
you remember, now, this one?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp8q p1">“Hilo, heylo,<br />
Tom was a merry boy,<br />
Hilo, heylo,<br />
Run before the wind!<br />
Heave to, my jolly Jacky,<br />
Pipe all for grog and baccy,<br />
Hilo, heylo,<br />
Run before the wind!”</p>

<p class="p1">“Ay! many’s the time! did he
learn you ‘Madagascar’? hey, what?”
Grandmother, for all reply, sang again:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">
“Up anchor, ’bout ship, and off to Madagascar!<br />
Cheerily, oh, cheerily, you hear the boat-swain call.<br />
Don’t you ship a Portagee, nor don’t you ship a Lascar,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Up foresail, out jib, and off to Madagascar,<br />
Call to Mother Carey for to keep her chicks at home.<br />
Ship me next to Martinique, or ship me to Alaska,<br />
But Polly’s got my heart at anchor, ne’er to roam.”<br />
</p>

<p class="p1">By and by when poor Mrs. Patton
ventured to put her timid head inside
the door, she kept it there, too astonished
to move.</p>

<p>Parker lay back on his pillows with
a look such as she had not seen for
many a long day. His thin hands were
beating time on the coverlet, and he
and Grandmother were singing together:</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Silver and gold in the Lowlands, Lowlands,<br />
Silver and gold in the Lowlands low;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp8">On the quay so shady<br />
I met a pretty lady,</p>
<p class="pp6">She stole away my heart in the Lowlands low.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Di’monds and pearls in the Lowlands, Lowlands,<br />
Di’monds and pearls in the Lowlands low;</p>
<p class="pp8">Daddy was a tailor,<br />
But I will die a sailor,</p>
<p class="pp6">And bury me my heart in the Low lands low!”</p>

<p class="p1">When the song was finished the old
sailor looked up and saw his wife
gaping in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Great bobstays! ‘Liza,” he said,
“Ain’t you got a drop of cider for Mis’
Merion to wet her throat with? You’d
let her sing herself dry as pop-corn, I
believe, and never stir a finger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, <i>Mr.</i> Patton!” said the poor
woman, and went to fetch the cider,
a great content shining in her face.
It was a good day when her husband
said “Great bobstays!”</p>

<p>Meantime Grandmother was not
much missed at the Farm. Manuel
indeed seemed more at ease when she
was not there; he did not look at her
much in these days, nor speak to her
except when need was. She never
seemed to notice, but was quiet and
cheerful as she always had been.</p>

<p>As for Rachel, she saw nothing, heard
nothing, but Manuel. She seemed
all day in a kind of breathless dream
of joy. But she meant to be good to
Grandmother. She was glad that
Grandmother had given up her room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to them, and taken the little back
one; she gloried in sitting at the
head of the table once more, and
ruling all like a queen. Manuel said
she was a queen; “Queen Poppy”
he used to call her; and Rachel
thought it quite true; if only she had
had the luck to be born a princess,
and Manuel a prince! Yes, she meant
to be good to Grandmother.</p>

<p>“Why, Grandmother,” she said one
day at table, “your hair is beginning
to turn! Look, Manuel! see the
white hairs!”</p>

<p>Manuel looked, and his face darkened,
but he said nothing.</p>

<p>“I declare,” said Rachel, “that’s
queer enough. I’d like to know what
care you have, Grandmother, to turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
your hair gray. I expect it’s not having
any that’s done it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rachel,” said Grandmother;
“perhaps that is it.”</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="reduct">HOW THE LIGHT CAME TO HER</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">All</span> this was before the child came.
With the coming of that little creature
the world changed once more for
Grandmother. It was in the early
autumn; the cardinal flowers were
past, but the St.-John’s-wort was in
its bloom of tarnished gold, and the
fringed gentian, too, was beginning to
open its blue eyes. Anne Peace remembered
this, because she had just
been out gathering gentians, and was
coming home with her hands full of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the lovely things, when she saw her
mother come to the door of Merion
House and wave a white apron. Anne
dropped the flowers. “Oh! Rachel!”
she said; and came running over.
The white apron meant that it was a
girl; if it were a boy the blue tablecloth
was to be waved.</p>

<p>“Doing well!” said Mother Peace.
“Grandmother has the baby in the
back chamber; you can see it, if you
like, Anne, only go quiet.”</p>

<p>As if Anne were ever anything but
quiet! Noiselessly she sped up the
back stairs, and opened the door of the
little bedchamber. There she saw&mdash;Madonna!</p>

<p>Grandmother was sitting in a low
rocking-chair, with the baby in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
arms, bending over it with eyes of
worship.</p>

<p>“Hush, Annie!” she said softly.
“Come and see a piece of heaven!”</p>

<p>Anne thought the heaven was in
Grandmother’s face; she never saw, she
said, such an angel look. She came
nearer, and looked at the tiny creature
nestling in its blankets. One little
pink fist was waving feebly. Grandmother
lifted it and laid it against her
cheek.</p>

<p>“Little velvet rose-leaf!” she murmured.
“Look, Anne! see the perfectness
of this! The little pink pearls
of nails, the tiny precious thumbkin.
Oh, wonderful, wonderful! How good
God is, to let us begin in this heavenly
way. How can we ever be anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
but good and lovely, when we begin
like this?”</p>

<p>“Some of us can’t,” said little Anne
shyly. “She is a darling, Grandmother.
Has Rachel seen her?”</p>

<p>A shade passed over Grandmother’s
rapt face. “Not yet!” she said. “She
ought to. If you see your mother,
Anne, you might tell her that baby is
washed and dressed. Darling, your
gown should be made of white rose-leaves,
shouldn’t it? and you the little
blush-rose heart? Oh, little piece of
heaven, how could they let you go?”</p>

<p>Anne stole away; looking back at
the door, she saw that Grandmother
had forgotten her and all the world
except the child; again it seemed Mary
that she was looking at; Mary in
adoration, as she had seen her in an
old engraving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>With the awe and wonder of this
still on her, she crept along the passage,
past the door of Rachel’s room, which
stood ajar. A fretful voice was speaking.
“No, I don’t want to see it. I
never wanted any at all, but if I had to
have one I wanted a boy; I don’t want
a girl. I won’t bother with it. It’s
hard enough to have to be one, and go
through what I’ve been through&mdash;and
then to have a girl! it ain’t fair;
it’s real mean!” An angry sob followed,
and Mother Peace’s calm voice
was heard.</p>

<p>“You want to be quiet now, Rachel,
and try to get a nap. You’ll feel different
when you’ve seen your baby.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
Shut your eyes now and mebbe you’ll
drop off, while I go and get you some
gruel.”</p>

<p>“I hate gruel!” said Rachel; “I
won’t touch it, Mis’ Peace, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Mother Peace came out quietly and
drew the door to. Seeing Anne she
nodded, and beckoned her to follow
down-stairs, but did not speak till she
had gained the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Anne,” she said. “You needn’t
tell me. There’s mistakes made up
yonder sometimes same as other places;
maybe some of the angels is young and
careless. But that baby’ll soon find
out who its real mother is, you see if
it don’t.”</p>

<p>“Why, Mother Peace,” said Anne,
“how you talk!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some one has to talk!” said her
mother kindly. “You are little better
than a dumb image, Anne, when a
person wants to free her mind. You
might stir this gruel if you’ve a mind
to, while I go up and take a look at
those two lambs, and I don’t mean
Rachel Merion by neither one of
‘em.”</p>

<p>Strange and terrible as it seems,
Rachel did not grow fond of her baby.
She had made up her mouth, she said,
for a boy; she had never liked girl
babies, and she wasn’t going to pretend
that she did.</p>

<p>“You needn’t look like that, Grandmother,
as if you expected the sky to
fall on me. I’m one that isn’t afraid
to say what I think, and I think it’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
real mean, so now, and I never shall
think anything else.”</p>

<p>Manuel too was greatly disappointed.
Rachel had been so absolutely sure,
that he too had counted on the promised
boy, feeling somehow that she must
know. They had named the child&mdash;Orlando
Harold was to be his name.
He was to have Manuel’s eyes and
Rachel’s hair, and was to be President
or Major-General; this was the only
point that was not settled. And now&mdash;still
Manuel felt a stirring at his heart,
when he saw the little fair creature in
Grandmother’s arms. “After all, there
have to be girls!” he said.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have to have one,” said
Rachel, flouncing away from him.</p>

<p>Mother Peace, while she nursed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Rachel faithfully and sturdily, grew
more and more rigid with indignation.</p>

<p>“Take this broth!” she would say.
“Yes, you will; take every sup of it;
there! If ’twasn’t for my living duty
I’d put whole peppercorns into it,
Rachel Merion. Such actions! what
the Lord was thinking of I don’t
know.” For Rachel was not nursing
the baby; said she could not, she
should die.</p>

<p>“I want a free foot,” she said;
“and they do just as well on a bottle,
Mis’ Peace.”</p>

<p>“They do not!” said Mrs. Peace.
“I’ll trouble you not to teach me to
suck eggs, Rachel. Now you are going
to take a nap, and much good may it
do you!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m not!” said Rachel.</p>

<p>“You are!” said Mrs. Peace, and
drew down the shades and went out
closing the door after her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peace’s indignation even extended
to Grandmother. “I believe
she don’t care, either!” she said.
“Grandmother, I really believe you
don’t care that Rachel is a heathen
and a publican, and had ought to be
slapped instead of fed and cockered
up.”</p>

<p>Grandmother looked up with a face
so radiant, it seemed to startle the
whole room into sudden light.</p>

<p>“Oh, but she will!” she said.
“She will care, dear Mrs. Peace.
She can’t possibly help it, you know,
when she comes to get about and hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the little darling angel, and feel its
little blessedness all warm in her arms.
She can’t help it then, my Precious
Precious, can she? Oh, Mrs. Peace,
she is smiling. Anne, Anne, come
quick, she is smiling.”</p>

<p>“Wind!” said Mrs. Peace calmly.</p>

<p>Grandmother flushed and looked
almost angry. “How can you, Mrs.
Peace?” she said. “But I know
better, I know! I almost heard them
whisper; I almost heard the rustle&mdash;”</p>

<p>“What rustle?” asked Anne under
her breath.</p>

<p>But Grandmother only smiled down
at baby. “Rachel says I may name
her!” she said. “Isn’t that kind of
her?”</p>

<p>Mrs. Peace sniffed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“What shall you call her?” asked
Anne.</p>

<p>“Faith!” said Grandmother.
“Sweet little Faith, God bless her!
and God bless us, and give us wisdom
to rear His heavenly flower fit for His
garden.”</p>

<p>Anne and I always said that the most
beautiful sight we had ever seen was
Baby Faith’s christening. It was in
October, a bright glorious day. Grandmother
hung great branches of maple
everywhere, making the sitting-room a
royal chamber with scarlet and gold.
Rachel had come down for the first
time and was on the sofa in a scarlet
wrapper, and Grandmother had
crowned her with golden leaves, and
told her she was the queen, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
come to the christening feast of the
princess. Rachel was all ready to be
crowned and petted. She kept Manuel
close by her side, or sent him now and
then on some little errand across the
room, never further&mdash;and snatched
him back again jealously. She did not
want him even to look at the baby,
though she liked well enough now to
look at it herself, had even grown a
little vain of it because people admired
it so.</p>

<p>“I think it’s real good of me to let
you name her, Grandmother!” she
said jealously. “And giving her such
a mean, poor-sounding name too: so
old-fashioned. Ruby Emerald is the
name I should have picked out, and
after all she’s my baby and not yours;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
but I’m not going back on what I said.
I never would do that, though if I was
in your place I shouldn’t want she
should have a name her own mother
despised.”</p>

<p>I don’t think Grandmother always
listened to Rachel; she certainly did
not seem to hear her now, for now the
minister came in, dear old Parson
Truegood. He stopped a moment in
the doorway, looking at Grandmother,
standing there in her white dress with
the baby in her arms. I think the
same thought was in his mind that
had come to Anne&mdash;the thought of
Mary and the Child&mdash;for he bowed
his head as if in prayer, just for a
minute. Then he came in, with his
cheery smile, and had just the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
word for Rachel and Manuel, and all
the time it was at the other two he
looked.</p>

<p>Little Faith was one of those babies
that are beautiful from the very first.
Some people will tell you there are
none such, but do not believe them.
Even the first day there was no mottled
depth of redness, only a kind of velvet
rose color. That soon faded away
and left the white rose instead that
Grandmother always called her. She
was not pasty white, nor waxen white;
it was a clear rosy whiteness; you see,
I have only the same word to say over
again. White Rose; that is what she
was. And every little feature perfect,
as if carved with a fairy-fine tool; and
her eyes like stars in blue water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Except Grandmother herself, she was
the most beautiful thing I ever saw.</p>

<p>She was asleep when the service
began; but when the water touched
her forehead she woke, and looked up
and smiled, a heavenly smile.</p>

<p>Grandmother looked up too, as if
she saw some one, or thought to see;
and I saw a listening look come over
her face, as if she heard some sound, or
hoped to hear. And when, a moment
later, she knelt down to pray, she
moved her dress a little aside, as if
making room for some one. Anne
knew what it meant. Grandmother
had told her. “I believe,” she said,
“that a baby’s angel stays by till after
it is christened. I can’t tell you just
how I know, but I hear&mdash;sometimes&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
hear sounds that aren’t this-world
sounds. And some one speaks to me&mdash;without
words, yet I understand&mdash;oh,
yes, I understand.”</p>

<p>It was a pretty fancy; she was full
of pretty fancies, many of them coming,
I suppose, from her lonely childhood.</p>

<p>And so Baby Faith was christened,
and became the light of Grandmother’s
life.</p>

<h2 class="p4">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="reduct">HOW HER HAIR TURNED WHITE</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">Now</span> followed the golden time of
Grandmother’s life. I hardly know
how to describe the change that came
over her with the coming of little Faith.
She seemed to grow taller, straighter,
fuller. The windflower was gone, and
instead there was a tall white lily,
growing firm and strong, sending its
roots deep down, spreading its broad
green leaves and silver petals abroad
to the sun.</p>

<p>She took all the care of the baby.
Rachel was not strong, and could not
bear to lose sleep, and Grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
joyfully declared that she slept the
better for having the cradle beside her
bed. Rachel slept late, and Grandmother
would take Baby down and
tuck her up in Grandfather’s great
chair while she got breakfast for Manuel
and herself, and then made ready the
pretty tray for Rachel. Then out she
would run into the garden with the
child in her arms, to get the morning
dew.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The morning dew to make you fair,<br />
The morning sun to curl your hair;</p>
<p class="pp8">The birds to sing to you,<br />
Fly to you, bring to you</p>
<p class="pp6">Everything sweet from everywhere.”</p>

<p class="p1">We realized now that many of
Grandmother’s little songs were her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
own; we could see them making;
they came bubbling up like bird-songs,
and she would try one word and
another, one note and another, till all
was to her mind.</p>

<p>“How do you do it, Grandmother?”
Anne Peace would say. And Grandmother
would laugh and say, “I don’t,
Anne. There isn’t any making about
it; they just come.”</p>

<p>She never used to laugh, except
with the children, but now she was
full of laughter and singing. How
could she help it? she would say.
Who could help singing with a baby
in the house, and such a baby as
Faith?</p>

<p>The children were inclined to be
jealous at first, all except “Saturday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Nelly,” as they called the little lame
girl. She simply fell down and worshipped
with Grandmother. The
others&mdash;well, it seemed strange to
some of them, especially the boys, to
have such a fuss made over a baby.
They had babies at home, that looked
(they thought in their ignorance) very
like this one; but no one ever called
them rose-leaf princesses or lily-bell
angels. To be sure, they often cried&mdash;squalled,
the boys called it&mdash;and this
one never seemed to, just smiled and
cooed.</p>

<p>“Why should she cry,” said Grandmother,
“when she is well and happy?
If she cries, children, it is our fault,
and we must be whipped round the
garden with bramble whips all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
thorns. So dance now, and make her
laugh!” Then they all would dance,
and Baby Faith would leap in Grandmother’s
arms, and crow, and wave her
little arms.</p>

<p>“Where did she come from?” asked
a little girl.</p>

<p>“Oh, I was just singing about
that before you came,” said Grandmother.
“Listen now, and you shall
hear.</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“Down from the sky came</p>
<p class="pp7">Little White Rose;</p>

Will they come after her,</p>
<p class="pp7">Do you suppose?”</p>

<p class="p1">“Will who come?” asked Benny
Mack.</p>

<p>“Angels!” said Grandmother.
“Troops of them, all shining with
great white wings spread, and
white lily-dresses; look up there,
Benny! what do you see in the
blue?”</p>

<p>“Clouds!” said Benny.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Grandmother. “But
I see something else, Benny; a white-lily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
lady sitting in a cloudy chair.
Don’t you see her, Nelly? Stay up
there, lily-lady; don’t come down here!
Baby Faith is very well, you cannot
have her back.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, children,” she said,
lowering her voice, “do you know all
the things that happened the day Baby
came? You don’t? come and sit round
here, all of you! Nelly-Nell, you shall&mdash;oh,
Nelly, you are so good and dear
and patient, you shall hold her a little,
while I tell. Listen now!</p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The lily-bells rang at the sight of her,<br />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“The daisies all danced ’neath the feet of her,<br />

<p class="pp8">The firefly’s spark<br />
Came and lit up the dark,</p>
<p class="pp6">Just to show us the picture complete of her!”</p>

<p class="p1">Two years; two golden, beautiful,
heavenly years. Then&mdash;it will not
be easy to tell this part, yet it must be
told.</p>

<p>Anne Peace thinks I am hard upon
Rachel; her mother used to think I
was just the reverse. She always
seemed to me the one wholly selfish
person I ever knew. She loved Manuel
passionately; but so jealously that she
did not even like to see him caress the
baby, but would call him to her side,
or make some excuse to give the child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
to Grandmother. And yet she was
so jealous of Grandmother too! I do
not think she ever cared much for the
baby, yet she would have fits of jealous
rage now and then.</p>

<p>“I’d like to know whose baby that
is, Grandmother!” she would say.
Grandmother would look up with the
rapt smile she always wore when little
Faith was in her arms.</p>

<p>“Whose baby? why, Rachel, don’t
you know? White Rose, look at
mother! throw a kiss to mother!”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as I do!” Rachel
would go on. “I thought ’twas mine;
I didn’t know as you’d had one,
Grandmother, but maybe I was mistaken;
maybe I just thought I had a
baby, and she was yours all along.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>Then suddenly stamping her foot,
she would flash out in the old way.</p>

<p>“I want you should understand that
that child belongs to me and Manuel,
and to no one else. I won’t have my
own child taken away from me; I tell
you I won’t! Give me my baby this
minute!” And she would snatch the
child from Grandmother’s arms. Of
course then the poor little thing would
begin to cry, frightened by her wild
looks and angry voice, and this only
enraged Rachel more. “You’ve turned
her against me!” she shrieked.
“You’ve stole her away from me, you
wicked, wicked&mdash;” here she would
break into a passion of furious sobs;
and Grandmother would take the baby
out of her arms and go away without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a word, leaving her to storm and rave
till Manuel came in to pet and caress
her into good humor again.</p>

<p>But again, it would be Manuel at
whom she would storm, accusing him
of abetting Grandmother in her designs
upon the baby; or still again, if
she had her wish of the moment, and
the baby was left with her for a few
minutes, she would find herself ill-used
and neglected, and left with all the care
of the child on her hands. Well! poor
Rachel!</p>

<p>One day&mdash;it was a bright fair day,
like any other summer day&mdash;Manuel
had promised to take Rachel for a
drive. “We might take Faith!” he
said; he had grown very fond of the
little one since she began to talk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“I don’t know as I want to!” said
Rachel, who was in a bad mood. “I’d
like to have a chance to talk to you once
in awhile myself, Manuel.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take Baby out in her carriage,”
said Grandmother happily. “We’ll
go to the woods, won’t we, White
Rose?”</p>

<p>That was enough. “No, you won’t!”
said Rachel. “If she’s going out she
can come with us. You put on her
things, Grandmother, while I get
mine.”</p>

<p>Grandmother carried little Faith out
to the wagon, and put her into her
mother’s arms, and waited to see them
start. It was surely a pretty sight,
Anne Peace said; she was watching
from her window. Rachel had a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
gipsy hat full of scarlet poppies tied
with scarlet ribbons under her chin.
Manuel was bare-headed, his crisp
black curls framing his brown handsome
face; and between the two dark
beauties the little White Rose with her
silver curls and apple-blossom face.
She was dancing up and down on
Rachel’s lap, clapping her hands at
the horse. A little piece of quicksilver
she was.</p>

<p>“Hold her tight, won’t you,
Rachel?” said Grandmother; “she
does jump about so, bless her!”</p>

<p>“I guess I know how to hold my
own child!” said Rachel.</p>

<p>So&mdash;they started, and Grandmother
waved good-bye, and then went
back to the house with a still look;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
peaceful and serene, but the radiant
light gone out of her face.</p>

<p>No one was ever to see that light
again.</p>

<p>They were gone about an hour.
Grandmother was in the garden watching
for them, when they came back.
It did not need her eyes to see that
something was terribly, terribly wrong.
Manuel was driving furiously, lashing
the horse, who galloped his best.
Rachel was in a heap on the floor
of the wagon moaning and crying;
what was that little white drift on her
knees, with the red stain creeping&mdash;</p>

<p>No! no! I cannot tell that part.</p>

<p>Next moment Grandmother had the
child in her arms. She towered like an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
avenging angel over the wretched
parents, who cowered at her feet.</p>

<p>“She isn’t dead!” shrieked Rachel.
“Grandmother, Grandmother, say she
isn’t dead. She’s only stunned a little,
I tell you. She&mdash;lost her balance&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Manuel cried out hoarsely: “No
lies now! we were quarrelling, and we
forgot her. She sprang out&mdash;” he
choked, and no more words came.</p>

<p>“<i>Only one hour!</i>” said Grandmother.
Three words; her terrible
eyes said the rest.</p>

<p>Grandmother fought for the child’s
life, silently, desperately. The doctor
came, a kind, quiet man, and they
worked together. He said a few cheering
words; but meeting Mrs. Peace’s
eyes, he shook his head sadly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>It lasted an hour or more; the spirit
nestled wonderingly in the little broken
body, lately all light and strength and
answering joy. The sweet eyes opened
once or twice, seeking the face that had
been their sun. It was there, bending
close; it smiled, and White Rose
smiled back. The last time, the baby
arms moved, fluttered up toward
Grandmother, then dropped; the eyes
closed.</p>

<p>Presently the doctor rose and went
out, with bowed head; he was a father
of children. The elder woman, weeping
silently, went to the window and
opened it wide; and the sunset light,
rosy and clear, streamed in on Grandmother,
sitting motionless, with the
dead child in her arms.</p>

<span class="reduct">HOW SHE FOUND PEACE</span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap mid">Next</span> day her hair was quite white,
as if it had been snowed on in the
night. But she was herself again, and
went quietly about the house, doing
all that had to be done, and waiting on
Rachel, who lay moaning and crying
in her darkened room, exhausted after
a night of hysterical passion. Grandmother
brought the breakfast tray, and
bathed her face and hands and brushed
her hair, in silence; she seemed unconscious
of her sobs and tears.</p>

<p>“I think you might say something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Grandmother!” Rachel whimpered.
“It’s dreadful enough, without your
going about looking like a stone image.
It isn’t your baby that&mdash;oh, dear!
and just as I was getting so fond of her.
She was just getting to the interesting
age. Oh, it’s too awful; isn’t it,
Grandmother?”</p>

<p>Grandmother did not heed her, but
went on brushing the heavy black hair
mechanically.</p>

<p>“I know you were fond of her,”
said Rachel, “and I sha’n’t say a
word about your keeping her away
from me so much. But of course you
can’t pretend to feel what I do, Grandmother.
You’ve never had a child,
you don’t know what a mother feels.
You’ve never had anything to feel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
really, all your life. Oh, dear! oh, dear!
and Manuel takes it so hard; I’m
sure I don’t know what is going to
become of us. Grandmother, if you
are going to be like a wooden stick, I
wish you’d go away and send Manuel
to me.”</p>

<p>Grandmother went without a word.
At the door she met the kind old
minister, the same who christened
Baby Faith&mdash;ah, how long ago? She
led him aside to the hall window, and
with one hand on his arm pointed
upward with the other.</p>

<p>“He let it happen. He sent the
little life, and then let it be crushed
out like the life of a fly or a worm.
Why?”</p>

<p>Her eyes looked through and through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
him, but the wise old eyes looked
back steadily and kindly.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” he said. “His great
laws are not made to be broken.
When we transgress them, it is ourselves
we break, against their divine
and unchangeable order.”</p>

<p>Grandmother’s head dropped on her
bosom. “I see!” she said.</p>

<p>She stood there quietly for awhile
after he had gone in to see Rachel;
then she went to find Manuel.</p>

<p>Manuel was sitting in the kitchen,
his head in his hands, staring moodily
before him. He looked up as Grandmother
came in, looked at her with
haggard eyes, then dropped his head
again.</p>

<p>“Go away!” he said hoarsely. “Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
away, you white thing! What have
you to do with murderers?”</p>

<p>“I never saw one,” said Grandmother
simply. “Poor Manuel, come
out into the garden. It isn’t good for
you to sit here and brood.”</p>

<p>“One place is as good as another,”
said Manuel. “Leave me
alone in the hell we have made, she
and I.”</p>

<p>Grandmother did not speak for a
time; then she said, “Manuel, God’s
will must be done in hell as much as
anywhere else.”</p>

<p>“God!” said Manuel; and he
laughed, an ugly laugh. “Do you still
believe in God after yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Oh, so much more!” said Grandmother;
and she added softly as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
she were saying over a lesson that she
had learned by heart, “His great
laws may not be broken. When we
transgress them, it is ourselves we
break&mdash;Come, Manuel, come out
into the sunshine.”</p>

<p>She spoke as to a child, and like a
child he obeyed, and followed her out
into the blossoming garden, all life
and color and fragrance. As the
glory shone upon him, the young man
staggered on the threshold and uttered
a groan; then he glanced at Grandmother.
“Your hair is as white as
snow!” he said.</p>

<p>“Is it?” said Grandmother. “It
doesn’t matter. We must gather
flowers, all the brightest flowers,
Manuel, for Little One. She liked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the gay ones best, and there is nothing
else to do&mdash;now.”</p>

<p>She moved away slowly, among her
flowers; she had grown heavy-footed
since yesterday; and the man followed
her with hanging head.</p>

<p class="p2">The thing that was between them,
instead of drawing Rachel and her
husband together, seemed to turn them
against each other. There were bitter
words, words that pierced and stung
like poisoned arrows; and every quarrel
left Rachel more hysterical, Manuel
more gloomy and silent, brooding over
that sweet past that had been flung
into the dust.</p>

<p>Grandmother would come out of
her dream and try hard to make peace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and she could always quiet Manuel,
but that often exasperated Rachel the
more. When the bitter tongue was
turned against her she did not seem to
hear, but lapsed again into the listless
half-dreaming state in which she lived
now, moving softly, doing with exquisite
care everything that was to be done,
but seeming little conscious of what
was going on around her.</p>

<p>Then came the day when Rachel
rushed wild-eyed into her room, as she
sat sewing by the empty cradle.</p>

<p>“Grandmother,” she cried; “something
is the matter with Manuel.
He’s&mdash;sick; he won’t speak to me.
Go and see what is the matter, quick!”</p>

<p>Grandmother went into the kitchen.
Manuel was sitting by the table as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
was that other day, his head in his
hands. He looked up and smiled at
her, a dull, foolish smile. “Grandmother,”
he said thickly, “I’m glad&mdash;see
you. I sent the other one away.
She’s no good; I’ve had enough of
her. No good! but you, Grandmother&mdash;you
weren’t always Grandmother;
what’s your other name?
I know&mdash;Pitia! give me a kiss,
Pitia! I always liked you best, you
know.”</p>

<p>He rose and staggered toward her.
She recoiled, her arms stretched out,
her face alight with anguish. “Don’t
come a step nearer!” she cried.
“Manuel&mdash;not a step!”</p>

<p>He stopped and stared at her
stupidly. Suddenly, swiftly, her face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
changed, softened into pity and tenderness
“Poor Manuel!” she said.
“Poor boy! come out into the air;
come with me!” Again the quiet hand
rested on his arm, compelling him,
again he stumbled out into the good
clear blessed sunshine. Poor Manuel!</p>

<p>Grandmother brought water and
bathed his aching head, and made him
lie down under the great russet-apple
tree where the shade was thick and
cool, and bade him sleep till the headache
was over. Then she came back
to Rachel, who watched half-jealous,
half-terrified, from the hall window.</p>

<p>What need to dwell on the time that
followed? Manuel had found the
thing that&mdash;for the moment&mdash;deadened
the pain at his heart and dulled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
his ears to Rachel’s reproaches and
complaints.</p>

<p>Some latent poison in the blood&mdash;who
can read these mysteries?&mdash;made
the drink a fire that consumed him.
He wasted away, and hugged his destroyer
ever closer to him. Grandmother
battled for his life, as she had
for that other sweet life which was the
light of her own; Rachel looked on
terrified and helpless.</p>

<p>Then came the winter night when he
fell down senseless by the garden gate
and lay there all night, while the
women watched and waited in the
house. It was Grandmother who found
him. She had persuaded Rachel to lie
down, and then thrown a cloak over
her wrapper and crept out in the gray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
iron-bound dawn to look down the
road for one who might be coming
stumbling along, and might need help
to gain the house; and she saw the
frozen face glimmering up from the
snow-bank where he lay.</p>

<p>There was one cry; a long low cry
that shivered through the still frosty
air; but no one heard.</p>

<p>How could she carry him in? We
never knew; she never spoke of it;
but no one else saw him till he was laid
decently in his bed and the staring
eyes closed. Then she called his wife.</p>

<p>The doctor came again, and good
Mrs. Peace, and all was done that
might be; but it was a bitter night,
and all was over, as Grandmother
knew at the first sight of that glimmering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
face. Poor Manuel! A fire of
straw, as Mother Peace said.</p>

<p>It was after this that Grandmother
had the long illness; when she lay for
weeks speechless and motionless, with
barely strength enough to move her
little finger for “Yes” or “No”
when we asked her a question. I
helped Mrs. Peace and Anne with the
nursing. Rachel had gone away to her
mother’s people. Sometimes, indeed
many times, we thought she was gone;
she lay so still; and we could not catch
even the slightest flutter of breath. I
remember those nights so well; one
moonlight night in particular. We
knew how she loved the moonlight,
and opened the shutters wide. It was
a cold still night, the snow silver white
under the moon. The light poured in
full and strong on the bed where she
lay like an ivory statue, and turned the
ivory to silver. I thought she was
dying then, and thought what a beautiful
way to die, the heavenly spirit
mounting along the moon-path, leaving
that perfect image there at rest.</p>

     <div class="caption"><p class="pc400">“SHE LAY LIKE AN IVORY STATUE.”</p>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>That was in February. April found
her still lying there, just breathing,
no more. The doctor gave a little
hope, now; she might slip away any
time, he said, but still it had lasted so
long, there must be a reserve of
strength; it was possible that she
might come through it.</p>

<p>One bright warm April day we had
opened the windows, and the air came
in sweet and fresh, and the robins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
were singing loud and merry in the
budding apple-trees.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the road outside came
a child’s laugh; sweet and clear it
rang out like a silver bell, and at the
sound the ivory figure in the bed moved.
A slight shiver rippled through it from
head to foot. The eyes opened and
looked at us, clear and calm.</p>

<p>Dear Anne Peace knelt down beside
the bed and took the slender transparent
hands in hers, the tears running
down her face. “Grandmother,” she
said, “you are going to get well now&mdash;for
the children! Spring has come,
Grandmother dear, and the children
need you!”</p>

<p>She did get well. Slowly but surely
life and strength returned; by June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
she was in the garden again with the
children around her. Not the same,
not the light-foot girl who frolicked
and ran with the other children, but as
you all remember her; serene, clear-eyed,
cheerful, full of wisdom, grace,
tenderness. Grandmother! who in
this village does not remember her?
To you young people she seemed an
old woman, with her snow-white hair
and ivory face, drawn into deep patient
lines. She was not fifty when she died.</p>

<p>During the twenty years she had yet to
live, what a benediction her days were
to old and young!</p>

<p>People came to her with their joys
and their sorrows. Strangers came,
from outlying places, and brought their
troubles to her; they had heard, no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
knows how, that she had power and
wisdom beyond that of other women.
I met one of these strangers once. I
was going in to see Grandmother, and
I met a lady coming away; a handsome
lady, richly dressed. She had been
weeping, but her face was full of light.</p>

<p>She looked at me. “Young woman,”
she said, “do you live near here?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” I said; “close by,
in that brown cottage.”</p>

<p>“Yours is a high privilege,” she
said, “to dwell so near to heaven.”</p>

<p>She looked back to the house and
kissed her hand to it; then beckoned,
and a fine carriage came up and she
drove away. I never knew who she
was.</p>

<p>I found Grandmother sitting quietly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with her knitting, by the empty
cradle.</p>

<p>“What did you say to that lady,
Grandmother?” I asked, though I
knew next moment I should not have
done it.</p>

<p>“I told her an old lesson, my dear,”
said Grandmother; “a lesson I learned
long ago.”</p>

<p>Once it was Saturday Nelly who
came; Nelly, now grown a woman&mdash;if
it could be called growing.</p>

<p>“Grandmother,” she said, “look
at me, and tell me what you see.”</p>

<p>Grandmother looked into the pale
drawn face with its strange eyes.</p>

<p>“Nelly dear,” she said, “I see a
face that I love, a face full of truth and
goodness.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“You see a monster!” said the poor
girl. She made a passionate gesture
toward a mirror that hung opposite
them; indeed, the glass showed a
strange contrast.</p>

<p>“Look!” she said. “Look, Grandmother,
and tell me! When one is
shut up in a prison like that, full of
pain and horror&mdash;hasn’t one a right
to get out if one can?”</p>

<p>Seeing the wonder in Grandmother’s
face she hurried on. “Father’s dead;
poor father! I would not let myself
think of it while he was living. He is
dead, and there is no one else&mdash;except
you, Angel, and you would understand,
wouldn’t you? If I put this thing to
sleep”&mdash;she struck her heart fiercely&mdash;“and
slipped out of prison&mdash;Grandmother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
what harm would it
do? what harm <i>could</i> it do?”</p>

<p>“Nelly! Nelly dear,” said Grandmother,
“you couldn’t&mdash;could you&mdash;go
with your lesson half-learned?
Such a strange, wonderful lesson, Nelly,
and you have been learning so well.
To go there, and when they asked you,
have to say ‘I didn’t finish, I left it
half-done, because I didn’t like it;’
<i>could</i> you do that, do you think, Nelly
dear? because&mdash;it wouldn’t be ready
at the other end either, don’t you see,
darling? It wouldn’t fit in. You
haven’t thought of that, have you,
Nelly?”</p>

<p>Nelly hid her face in her hands, and
there was a long silence. Presently
she spoke, low and trembling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>“Grandmother&mdash;suppose there
wasn’t any other end! Suppose I
couldn’t see&mdash;suppose I didn’t believe
there was&mdash;anything more&mdash;when
this hateful thing”&mdash;she plucked
at her poor twisted body as if she would
have torn it&mdash;“is buried out of
sight with the other worms! what
then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Nelly!” said Grandmother
softly. “Nelly dear! if it were so;
if this were the only lesson, mustn’t
we try all the harder to learn it well?
if this should be our only chance to
help and love and tend and cheer,
would we give up one minute of
the time? Oh, no! Nelly, no!
Think a little, my dear! think a
little!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>We all remember Saturday Nelly,
in the little shop that Grandmother
set up for her, selling sweeties to the
children, selling thread and needles
and tape, tending her birds and flowers,
the cheeriest, gayest little soul in the
village. Her shop was a kind of centre
of merry innocent chatter for young and
old; it was full from morning to night.
We never thought much about Nelly’s
looks except when we spoke of Grandmother;
then her face grew beautiful.</p>

<p>I think the children loved Grandmother
better even than in her girl-days.</p>

<p>The Saturday feasts were quieter,
but still full of light and joy, and the
stories&mdash;well, they were like no other
stories that ever were told.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p class="pp6q p1">“And oh! the words that fell from her mouth,<br />
Were words of wisdom and of truth.”</p>

<p class="p2">So she lived, blessing and blessed,
twenty more heavenly years; and so,
when God called her, she died. We
found her one morning sitting by the
little cradle, her head resting on it, and
a white rose in her quiet hand. When
we raised her face and looked at it,
there was no need to ask whither the
spirit had gone.</p>

<p class="p2">And Rachel? A year after Manuel
died, she married a man from a neighboring
village, a masterful man who
broke her over his knee like a willow
switch, and whom she adored for the
rest of her life. She bore him sons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
daughters, and grew&mdash;comparatively&mdash;cheerful
and placid.</p>

<p>She came to see Grandmother now
and then, and marvelled at her.</p>

<p>“How you do age, Grandmother!”
she would say. “And you without a
care in the world. I wonder what
would have happened if you had really
lived, as I have!”</p>

<p class="pc4 mid">THE END.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
